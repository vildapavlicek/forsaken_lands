## Narrative Summary (One-Paragraph Version)
On a completely dead world, the last surviving village can only endure by fighting monsters that emerge from a mysterious portal opened by a weak, nameless god. Killing these monsters and recycling their remains is the sole source of resources. By offering worship, the villagers empower the god, allowing it to open stronger portals that bring greater danger and greater rewards. The player manages this cycle, balancing survival, escalation, and faith in a world where nothing grows and everything must be taken.
