# Game idea
Village in forsaken world that has become barren and unable to sustain life get their last prayer answered by nameless god which creates (temporary) portal from which enemies pour out. Killing enemies enables looting resources from the dead which brings new opportunities.

# Core loop
Killing enemies spawned by the portal and looting them (and butchering) for resources.

# Future plans / features
## Portal levels
We can have different portals with different attributes. Reaching certain portal level would unlock new portal. This would allow interesting progression.

## Reverse-engineering research
Enemies that are technologically advanced could allow reverse-engineering of their technology.

# Divinity System
I had idea about where lower tier divinity cannot hurt higher tier divinity. Thus creating kind of level-check.
This would be global stat for village and then applied to every hero. However it could be cool feature to have divinity
as a per-hero stat and when hero would like to tier up his/her divinity, there would be quest required.

# Skill fragment
Monsters would drop skill fragments. If enough fragments are dropped, skill could be researched as a technology. Then fragments could be used ot learn and level up given skill.

## Example: Trap
Goblin Scout would drop `trap_skill_fragment` item with chance of 10%. For research we would need 10 skill fragments. To learn we would need 10 fragments. For level up 10, 20, 50, 100 etc..
