# Game idea
Village in forsaken world that has become barren and unable to sustain life get their last prayer answered by nameless god which creates (temporary) portal from which enemies pour out. Killing enemies enables looting resources from the dead which brings new opportunities.

# Core loop
Killing enemies spawned by the portal and looting them (and butchering) for resources.

# Future plans / features
## Portal levels
We can have different portals with different attributes. Reaching certain portal level would unlock new portal. This would allow interesting progression.

## Reverse-engineering research
Enemies that are technologically advanced could allow reverse-engineering of their technology.
