# Game idea
Village in forsaken world that has become barren and unable to sustain life get their last prayer answered by nameless god which creates portal spawning enemies. Killing enemies enables looting resources from the dead which brings new opportunities.

# Core loop
Killing enemies spawned by the portal and looting them (and butchering) for resources.

# Future plans / features
## Portal levels
We can have different portals with different attributes. Reaching certain portal level would unlock new portal. This would allow interesting progression.

## Reverse-engineering research
Enemies that are technologically advanced could allow reverse-engineering of their technology.

# Skill fragment
Monsters would drop skill fragments. If enough fragments are dropped, skill could be researched as a technology. Then fragments could be used ot learn and level up given skill.

## Example: Trap
Goblin Scout would drop `trap_skill_fragment` item with chance of 10%. For research we would need 10 skill fragments. To learn we would need 10 fragments. For level up 10, 20, 50, 100 etc..

# Totems
totems crafted and placed at predetermined(?) places providing buffs/debuffs (slow, damage, reduce HP, etc)

# Missions
Send heroes on mission, can reward technology unlock, xp, skill shard

# Great goal
revitalization of planet?
