The progression should follow from very basic and primitive tools to more complex ones by utilizing resources gathered from enemies.
Weapon upgrades should be closely followed by the research progression as well as enemy progression.

The draft for a progression should be as follows:

1. enemies appear from portal, we kill them with rocks we find
2. as more enemies appear from the portal, it is clear we might need better weapons
3. unlocked simple crafting research
4. sharp rocks, deal more damage with rocks 
5. as we kill more and more enemies their bodies start to pile up
6. unlock corpse scavenging research
7. unlock sling recipe
8. we need even better tools, bones are piling up
9. research bone crafting,
10. recipe bone mace, bone bow
11. break bones into bone dust to enhance bones, bones make toughter bones 
12. unlock weapon upgrades, repeatable research, affects only bone-crafted weapons

NOTE: Each weapons should be use-able for 2-3 levels before replaced by another. Thus 3 types of weapons should takes us from level
1 to level 9 or 10.
NOTE 2: For start, we will make the transition as meelee rock > sling > bone weapons, let's say meelee rock will be only weapon for first 3 levels when it should be replaced by sling, later weapons should come in pairs so player can choose

The issue with weapons is that in early levels ranged weapons will probably be preferred over melee due to ranged enemies

Levels 1-5 are meant to be tutorial levels, let player to familizarize with UI and core loop kill > scavenge > research
